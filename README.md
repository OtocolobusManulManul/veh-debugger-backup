## dependancies:

	- Win32 2022 SDK
	- MSVC 2022 C++ compiler (x64)
	- IDA pro 7.6 or above
	- python 3
	- git (no fucking shit)
	- Elite Dangerous

## todo

	- write some sort of python script that helps with combining symbol files
	- rewrite the interrupt reset loop so it uses a queue to improve perrormance
	- interface for setting hooks at runtime
	- support for watching/writing memory at runtime
	- set hooks at given function offset (they effectively just become breakpoints at that point lol)
